-RDF-queue--last-player-request
===============================

hello everyone, there is a problem about the queue for RDF's.
the problem shows to the "bugged" players that the RDF queue system request healer/dps/tank
and when they queue or tell to their friends to queue  they are not getting any thing or queue for ready check to the RDF.
and if they get any queue,at the ready check for the RDF the last dps cant accept the queue.
